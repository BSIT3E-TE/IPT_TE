            <p><b>About Me</b><br><br>Hi I'm Te, Kenth Luise and I am a 20-year-old Filipino student currently in my third year of Information Technology at City of Malabon University. Born on May 8, 2004, in Manila, I have always had a natural interest in technology, which led me to pursue a degree in IT. With a basic foundation in tech and an understanding of the lucrative opportunities in the field, I am excited to expand my knowledge and skills. Outside of my studies, I enjoy playing online games as a hobby. As a Catholic and a single individual, I am focused on building a successful future in the tech industry.</p>
